# DnD-Manager
Software to make being a DM for D&D 3.5e easier. Will allow for automation of many tedious tasks

(WIP) Character Randomizer -

Three modes of randomization
Full Random: Will completely randomize everything about a character, not caring about synergy or common sense
Smart Random: Will Randomize many aspects of a character and assign stats and skills wisely, but will leave out things that someone might want to manually input
Force Best: Will create a character with the best synergy, but not very random. Mostly only varies in the randomized stat rolls

Aspects that will be randomized with customization available:
- Class
- Race
- Stat Points
- Languages
- Feats
- Skills
- Magic


(Possible Future Implementation) Encounter Randomizer - 

Will create an encounter based on the following criteria:
- Party Level
- Location
- Group or Boss Encounter
- Any additional filters set by DM
